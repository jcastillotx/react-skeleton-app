GEMINI-*.md                    # Memory bank files (separate from Claude)
```

### Setup Steps

1. **Configure GEMINI.md**

The file is already configured. Key points:

touch GEMINI-decisions.md
touch GEMINI-troubleshooting.md
touch GEMINI-config-variables.md
```

3. **Initialize GEMINI-activeContext.md**

```markdown
# Active Context

## Current Session
- **Date**: [today's date]
- **Goal**: Initial setup

## Progress
- [x] Gemini CLI configured
```

### Features Available

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Subagents | ❌ None | Not supported |
| Memory Bank | ✅ Full | GEMINI-*.md files |
| Commands | ❌ None | Not supported |
| Skills | ❌ None | Not supported |
| MCP Servers | ❌ None | Not supported |

### Important Behavioral Differences

- **Strict adherence**: Only does exactly what asked
- **No suggestions**: Won't offer unsolicited advice
- **Scope limitation**: Won't expand on requests
- **Clarification first**: Asks before exceeding scope

## 9. Multi-Platform Setup

### When Using Multiple AI Tools

If you switch between platforms, follow these practices:

### Shared Configuration

```
docs/
├── AGENT_HANDBOOK.md       # Single source of truth (all platforms)
├── WORKFLOW.md             # Shared workflow (all platforms)
└── VIBE_CODING_WORKFLOW.md # Master reference (all platforms)

CLAUDE-*.md                 # Shared by: Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, Blackbox, Codex
GEMINI-*.md                 # Gemini-only (separate system)
```

### Gitignore for Memory Banks

```gitignore
# Memory bank files - never commit
CLAUDE-activeContext.md
CLAUDE-temp.md
GEMINI-activeContext.md
GEMINI-temp.md

# Keep patterns and decisions - useful for team
# CLAUDE-patterns.md
# CLAUDE-decisions.md
```

### Session Handoff

When switching platforms mid-session:

1. **Update Active Context**

```markdown
# CLAUDE-activeContext.md

## Platform Handoff
- **Previous**: Claude Code
- **Current**: Cursor
- **Reason**: [why switching]
- **State**: [what was in progress]
```

2. **Sync Memory Banks** (if using Gemini)

Gemini uses separate files, so manually sync important context:

```bash
# Copy key context from Claude to Gemini
cp CLAUDE-patterns.md GEMINI-patterns.md
cp CLAUDE-decisions.md GEMINI-decisions.md
```

### Recommended Primary Platform

| Use Case | Recommended | Why |
|----------|-------------|-----|
| Full AI orchestration | **Claude Code** | Most features |
| IDE-integrated | **Cursor** | Best integration |
| Quick edits | **GitHub Copilot** | Fastest |
| Strict instructions | **Gemini CLI** | No scope creep |
| Lightweight | **Windsurf/Cline** | Simple setup |
