# AI Project Governance Starter

> **Vibe Coding Boilerplate** - Complete AI-assisted development from conception to production

This repository provides a **comprehensive framework** for AI-assisted ("vibe") development, covering the entire lifecycle from initial concept through brand discovery, development, testing, security audits, and production deployment.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1: Copy to Your Project

```bash
# Clone or copy this boilerplate to your project root
git clone https://github.com/your-org/vibe-skeleton-app.git my-project
cd my-project
```

### Step 2: Configure Your AI Tool

| Your Tool | Configuration File | Setup |
|-----------|-------------------|-------|
| Claude Code | `CLAUDE.md` | Ready to use |
| Cursor | `.cursor/rules.md` + `.cursor/mcp.json` | Import MCP servers in settings |
| Cline | `.clinerules` + `.cline/mcp_settings.json` | Ready to use |
| Windsurf | `.windsurfrules` | Configure MCP in settings |
| Copilot | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | Ready to use |

### Step 3: Set Environment Variables

```bash
# Copy and fill in your API keys
cp .env.example .env

# Required keys for full functionality:
# - GITHUB_TOKEN (GitHub MCP)
# - FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN (Design integration)
# - SUPABASE_URL + SUPABASE_ANON_KEY (Database)
# - SONAR_TOKEN (Code quality)
# - SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN (Error monitoring)
```

### Step 4: Start Your First Project

```bash
# Create initial planning documents
mkdir -p docs/project assets/logo assets/media

# Start with Project Identity (see execution guide below)
```

## 📋 Execution Guide: Conception to Production

### Phase -1: Project Identity (ALWAYS FIRST)

**Before ANY discovery, capture these 5 required items:**

```markdown
## Project Identity (Required)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Application Name** | [Name of the app/product] |
| **Company Name** | [Company or organization] |
| **Author Name** | [Primary author/creator] |
| **License Type** | Proprietary (default) / MIT / Apache 2.0 |
| **Contact Email** | [Primary contact email] |
```

**AI Prompt to Start:**
```
I'm starting a new project. Before we begin any discovery, 
I need to capture the project identity:

1. What is the application name?
2. What is the company/organization name?
3. Who is the author/creator?
4. What license type? (Proprietary is default for commercial projects)
5. What is the primary contact email?
```

**After capturing identity, automatically generate:**
- LICENSE file
- README header
- package.json/composer.json fields
- File header templates

---

### Phase 0: Brand & Design Discovery

**Before ANY development, complete brand discovery:**

```markdown
## Start Brand Discovery

1. Open: docs/BRAND_AND_DESIGN_DISCOVERY.md
2. Complete ALL intake questions:
   - Brand Identity (Questions 1-10)
   - Visual Preferences (Questions 11-16)
   - Inspiration & References (Questions 17-22)
   - Tone of Voice (Questions 23-27)
3. Gather assets:
   - [ ] Logo files (SVG, PNG)
   - [ ] Brand colors (hex codes)
   - [ ] Typography choices
   - [ ] Inspiration images
   - [ ] Existing brand guide (if any)
4. Create: docs/project/BRAND_GUIDE.md
5. Create: assets/logo/ and assets/media/
```

**AI Prompt to Start:**
```
I'm starting a new project. Let's begin with brand discovery.
Please ask me the brand discovery intake questions from 
docs/BRAND_AND_DESIGN_DISCOVERY.md one section at a time.
```

### Phase 1: Project Conception

```markdown
## Create Project Brief

1. Open: docs/DEVELOPMENT_ORCHESTRATION.md
2. Complete Phase 0: Conception questions
3. Create: docs/project/PROJECT_BRIEF.md
4. Get stakeholder approval
```

**AI Prompt:**
```
Based on our brand discovery, let's create the project brief.
Ask me the conception intake questions and help me document
the project brief in docs/project/PROJECT_BRIEF.md
```

### Phase 2: Requirements Gathering

```markdown
## Define Requirements

1. Create user stories with acceptance criteria
2. Define functional requirements
3. Define non-functional requirements
4. Create: docs/project/USER_STORIES.md
5. Create: docs/project/REQUIREMENTS.md
```

**AI Prompt:**

Help me create user stories with acceptance criteria
following the template in docs/DEVELOPMENT_ORCHESTRATION.md
```

### Phase 3: Architecture & Planning

```markdown
## Design Architecture

1. Create: docs/project/ARCHITECTURE.md
2. Create ADRs in docs/project/adr/
3. Create: docs/project/SPRINT_PLAN.md
4. Set up project board (Linear/Jira/GitHub)
```

**AI Prompt:**
```
Let's design the architecture for this project.
Based on our requirements, recommend the tech stack
and create the architecture document with ADRs.
```

### Phase 4: Development

```markdown
## Start Development

1. Create feature branch: git checkout -b feature/[story-id]-[description]
2. Update CLAUDE-activeContext.md with current task
3. Follow TDD: Write tests first
4. Implement feature
5. Create PR with checklist
```

**AI Prompt:**
```

Let's follow TDD - help me write the tests first,
then implement the feature following our patterns.
```

### Phase 5: Testing

```markdown
## Run Test Suite

1. Unit tests (80%+ coverage)
2. Integration tests
3. E2E tests with Playwright
4. Accessibility audit
5. Performance testing
```

**AI Prompt:**
```
Let's run our test suite and ensure quality.
Check test coverage and help me add any missing tests.
Run the Playwright MCP for E2E testing.
```

### Phase 6: Security Audit

```markdown
## Security Review

1. Run SAST scan (SonarQube/Semgrep)
2. Run dependency scan (Snyk)
3. Review OWASP Top 10
4. Create: docs/project/SECURITY_AUDIT.md
```

**AI Prompt:**
```
Let's perform a security audit on this codebase.
Check for vulnerabilities using the security scanning
tools and create a security audit report.
```

### Phase 7: Code Review & Merge

```markdown

2. Request peer review
3. Address feedback
4. Merge to main
```

### Phase 8: Deployment

```markdown
## Deploy to Production

2. Run smoke tests
3. Get stakeholder approval
4. Deploy to production
5. Verify deployment
```

**AI Prompt:**
```
Let's deploy this release. First to staging for verification,
then to production. Help me run through the deployment checklist.
```

### Phase 9: Monitoring

```markdown
## Monitor Production

1. Set up Sentry alerts
2. Configure dashboards
3. Monitor error rates
4. Track performance metrics
```

## ✅ Golden Rules

1. **Brand First** - Complete brand discovery before development
2. **Plan Mode** - Always ask intake questions before coding
3. **Small Changes** - Keep commits minimal and reviewable
4. **Test First** - Write tests before implementation (TDD)
5. **Document Always** - Update docs when behavior changes
6. **Security Check** - Audit before every release
7. **Never Commit Secrets** - Use environment variables
